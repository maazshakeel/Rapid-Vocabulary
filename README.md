# Rapid-Vocabulary

#### How I got the idea?
So I recently started focusing on English too much and the reason behind this is (will let you know very soon) and then I realized that I need words to speak so after if I started increasing my vocabulary so I started reading books :books: and others ways to increase my vocabulary but I learned So I recently started focusing on English too much and the reason behind this is (will let you know very soon) and then I realized that I need words to speak so after if I started increasing my vocabulary 15 words a day or no word all or 15 words a week. So from here, I get the idea of Rapid Vocabulary (will change the name later on :sweat_smile:)

People can easily store and increase their vocabulary rapidly.

So, there will be so many features that I've planned. 

### Features:

- Their own database of the words.

- Sample database of very basic words.

- A new word every day and they’ll have the option to add it to the database.

- They can set the goal yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily of how many words they will gonna learn in a particular time according to the goal, and we’ll remind them of the goal and suggest some new words and books maybe.

- They can take a picture of the words written in the notebook and can easily add the words to the database and they’ll have the option to store all of the words in the database with suitable meanings. 

- They can search for the meaning.
